##This project is a real-time web-based chat application that allows users to communicate instantly with one another. 
It is built using Node.js on the backend and Socket.IO for enabling real-time, two-way communication between the server and clients.
The frontend is developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for typing and sending messages. 
The backend uses Express.js to serve static files and handle WebSocket connections.
Whenever a user sends a message, it is broadcasted to all connected users in real time â€” without the need to refresh the page
